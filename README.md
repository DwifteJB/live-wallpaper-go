# Live-wallpaper GO

Just a quick project that I tried making to test the language golang, on MacOS it seems to be super slow changing wallpapers due to how [this](github.com/reujab/wallpaper) module works (by using osascript), theres also some bugs on MacOS with setting the wallpaper back, but this was just a quick 30 minute project!

## How to compile

    go build
